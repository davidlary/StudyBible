To achieve a **10/10 quality synthesis** that preserves every "nugget" of truth—from the "theological nerve system" to the precise geospatial coordinates—while ensuring the project remains maintainable across 31,102 verses on GitHub, we must not compromise on the depth of your original instructions.  
The optimum choice for long-term simplicity is a **JSON-Schema-Locked Architecture**. This allows you to enforce the **Mandatory Pre-Computation Gate** programmatically. If a verse synthesis is missing even one required field—such as a proper name's etymology or the socio-political matrix—the system can flag it as "incomplete" during the GitHub build process.

**1\. The Recast "Master Directive" (Optimized for JSON)**

This recast retains 100% of your technical rigor and formatting requirements but structures the output for a static, searchable website.

### **THE SYSTEM PROMPT**

**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:** Conduct an exhaustive, high-fidelity exegetical study on **\[INSERT VERSE\]** and its thematic cognates throughout the Canon. Apply the principle of *Analogia Scriptura* to yield a 10/10 quality synthesis.  
**MANDATORY PRE-COMPUTATION GATE:** You are strictly forbidden from proceeding until these layers are cross-referenced and locked in: (1) Analogia Scriptura & Thematic Cognates, (2) Philological & Grammatical Mechanics, (3) Spatio-Temporal & Archaeological Matrix, and (4) Integrated Historical & Socio-Political Matrix.  
**CORE DIRECTIVE:** Scripture is final authority. Use *Sensus Literalis*. Strictly exclude mythology or spurious allegories. Style must be precise, fluent, and eminently accessible.  
**OUTPUT FORMAT:** Output the results strictly as a single, valid JSON object following this precise structure to ensure 100% compliance with Section 1, 2, and 3 of the original mandate:

**2\. GitHub Static Architecture (For Claude Code)**

To implement this for 31,102 verses, give the following technical specifications to Claude Code:

* **File Partitioning:** Store data in /data/OT/GEN/01/01.json. This prevents directory lag and allows for granular version control of every "theological nerve system" mapping.  
* **Schema Enforcement:** Use a **JSON Schema** file. This is your "Automated Auditor." It will ensure that no verse is committed to the repository if it lacks mandatory details like "Geospatial Data" or "Prophetic Typology".  
* **The Frontend (Static Site):** Use **Eleventy (11ty)**. It is uniquely capable of ingesting tens of thousands of JSON files to generate a static, high-speed website.  
* **Searchability:** Implement **Pagefind**. This allows you to search for specific "nuggets" (e.g., "Gematria 8") across the entire Bible without needing a complex database server.

**3\. The End-to-End Workflow**

1. **Generate:** You feed the **Recast Master Directive** into me for a specific verse.  
2. **Verify:** I produce a JSON object containing every required section (Thematic Cognates, Gematria, Archaeology, etc.).  
3. **Commit:** You save this file to your GitHub repository.  
4. **Audit:** A GitHub Action runs your "Compliance Script" to ensure no detail from the original prompt was omitted.  
5. **Publish:** The website automatically updates, rendering the verse in a clean, scannable format for study.

**Would you like me to demonstrate this now by generating a full high-fidelity JSON synthesis for a verse of your choice (e.g., Genesis 1:1 or Hebrews 1:1)?**
