It shows Peter being welcomed, a practice central to early Christian ethics. The passive voice implies Peter is the recipient of hospitality, which is significant as he is being prepared to extend God's 'welcome' to the Gentiles."

This shared name may serve as a literary device to link the two men, subtly suggesting that Simon Peter must 'hear' God's new command, just as his host has 'heard' the call to offer hospitality."

For Peter, a devout Jew, to lodge in such a home was already a significant crossing of a purity boundary, preparing his heart for the much larger boundary-crossing of entering a Gentile's home."

        "entry": "sea (θάλασσαν, thalassan)",
        "theological_significance": "Refers to the Mediterranean Sea. In the Jewish mindset, the sea often represented chaos, the unknown, and the realm of the Gentiles. The house's location on this boundary between land and sea symbolically places Peter at the threshold of the Gentile world, from which his next mission will launch."
      }
    ],
    "literary_devices": "The verse employs a high degree of specificity ('a certain Simon', 'a tanner', 'house by the sea') which serves to enhance its verisimilitude (the appearance of being true or real), a hallmark of Luke's historiography. The setting in Joppa, by the sea, creates a powerful intertextual allusion to the story of Jonah, casting Peter's impending obedience in stark contrast to Jonah's disobedience in the same location.",
    "aggregate_analogia_scriptura": "This verse is a practical prelude to the theological revelation in Acts 10:9-16. Peter's willingness to lodge with an 'unclean' tanner demonstrates a heart already being prepared by the Spirit to understand that what God has cleansed, no one should call common or unclean (Acts 10:15). This principle, first applied to food in the vision, is ultimately about people—the Gentiles. Peter's location physically prefigures his spiritual journey. This moment fulfills the trajectory of Jesus's own ministry, who regularly associated with the ritually and socially 'unclean' (Mark 2:15-17) and declared all foods clean (Mark 7:19). It sets the stage for the fulfillment of the Great Commission to 'all nations' (Matthew 28:19).",

    "prophetic_typology_and_intertextuality": {
      "type_shadow": "Jonah in Joppa represents the 'type' of a prophet reluctant to obey God's call to bring a message of repentance to Gentiles (the Ninevites). His flight from Joppa via the sea symbolizes the resistance within Old Covenant thinking to embrace the 'unclean' nations.",
      "antitype_fulfillment": "Peter in Joppa is the 'antitype' or fulfillment. He is the apostle who, from the very same city, will obey the call to go to the Gentiles (Cornelius's household). Where Jonah fled from his mission, Peter will embrace his. The sea, which for Jonah was an escape route, becomes for Peter the horizon of a new, worldwide mission. Peter's obedience reverses Jonah's disobedience.",
      "progression_notes": "This narrative demonstrates a key moment in redemptive history, showing the expansion of God's salvific plan from being primarily focused on Israel to explicitly including all nations, as prophesied in Isaiah 49:6. It is the practical application of the mystery revealed to Paul, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs in Christ (Ephesians 3:6)."

      "context": "The early church was still predominantly Jewish, grappling with the implications of the New Covenant for non-Jews. This episode marks the first sanctioned, Spirit-led mission to a Gentile household, setting a crucial precedent that would be debated in Jerusalem (Acts 11, 15) and form the basis of Paul's later ministry."
    },
    "socio_political_matrix": "A tanner's profession was socially and religiously problematic. The handling of dead carcasses rendered a person ceremonially unclean (Lev. 11:39-40), and the process created a foul stench, leading to social ostracism. Mishnaic law (the codification of Jewish oral tradition) often required tanneries to be located outside of city walls and downwind. The location 'by the sea' served the practical need for water and the social requirement of separation. For Peter, the chief apostle, to stay in such a home was a radical act of humility and a bridge across a significant socio-religious divide, preconditioning him for the greater divide he was about to cross with Cornelius.",

Its location made it the primary seaport for Jerusalem, located about 55 km to the southeast. The climate is Mediterranean, with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The house's location 'by the sea' would have been on the western edge of the town, exposed to sea breezes."

Archaeological work in Jaffa has extensively documented its long history as a port city dating back to the Bronze Age, confirming its significance as described in the Bible (e.g., Jonah 1:3; 2 Chronicles 2:16). The existence of a tanning industry in such a coastal location is historically and economically plausible."
