    "standalone_english_translation": "So Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. The next day he got ready and went with them, and some of the believers from Joppa accompanied him.",
    "amplified_narrative_translation": "Consequently, Peter took the personal initiative of inviting these Gentile men inside, and he provided them with full hospitality as honored guests for the night. Then, on the very next day, he arose and departed on the journey with them, and he was deliberately accompanied by a select group of the fellow believers who were from the city of Joppa."

        "The verse records two foundational actions of Peter: first, personally inviting the Gentile messengers in (εἰσκαλεσάμενος), and second, providing them with lodging and food (ἐξένισεν).",
        "This hospitality is the immediate, tangible act of obedience to the divine revelation Peter received in the vision of the great sheet (Acts 10:9-16, 10:28).",
        "Peter's obedience is not delayed intellectual agreement but an immediate, physical, and socially radical act, intentionally breaking powerful Jewish purity customs that forbade table fellowship with Gentiles.",
        "The narrative deliberately marks the passage of time: the hospitality happens overnight, and the journey begins 'on the next day' (Τῇ δὲ ἐπαύριον).",
        "Crucially, Peter does not undertake this mission alone; 'certain of the brothers from Joppa' accompany him, serving as official witnesses to the events that will unfold."

        "Peter’s hospitality (from ξένος, 'stranger') is a direct fulfillment of the Abrahamic Covenant's core promise: 'in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed' (Genesis 12:3).",
        "Abraham himself is the 'Type' of this hospitality, unknowingly welcoming angelic messengers at Mamre (Genesis 18:1-8), an act later codified as a model for believers (Hebrews 13:2).",
        "This action restores the original intent of the Mosaic Law, which explicitly commanded care for the foreigner (גֵּר, ger): 'You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself' (Leviticus 19:34).",
        "Peter's welcome is the apostolic 'Antitype' to the nationalistic exclusivity that characterized later Judaism, breaking down the 'dividing wall' (Ephesians 2:14).",
        "This moment is the historical actualization of Isaiah's prophecy that Gentiles would be joined to the Lord and brought to His holy mountain (Isaiah 56:6-7).",
        "Peter's journey from Joppa to the Gentile centurion Cornelius is the pivotal event that opens the door for the explosive Gentile mission, fulfilling Christ's commission to make disciples of 'all nations' (Matthew 28:19)."

      "points": [
        "[εἰσκαλεσάμενος] (eiskalesamenos, 'having invited in'): The aorist middle participle emphasizes that Peter himself took the personal initiative to welcome them, acting decisively on God's command.",
        "[ἐξένισεν] (exenisen, 'he showed hospitality'): The verb's root is [ξένος] (xenos, 'stranger, foreigner'). Peter's action linguistically and socially transforms these men from 'unclean outsiders' to 'honored guests,' a radical redefinition of identity.",
        "[Πέτρος] (Petros, 'Rock/Stone,' the subject of the verb): The 'Rock' upon whom Christ would build His church (Matthew 16:18) is here laying a foundational cornerstone for the inclusion of the Gentile world into that very church.",
        "[Ἰόππης] (Ioppēs, 'Joppa,' meaning 'Beauty'): This is the very same port city from which the prophet Jonah fled to escape his mission to the Gentiles of Nineveh (Jonah 1:3). Peter's departure from Joppa to embrace the Gentiles constitutes a profound thematic reversal and redemptive correction of Jonah's disobedience.",
        "[ἀδελφῶν] (adelphōn, 'brothers'): The use of this specific term for Peter's companions underscores their status as co-believers in the Messiah, whose testimony would be critical for validating this new work of the Spirit to the skeptical church in Jerusalem (Acts 11:12)."

        "The setting in Joppa creates a significant literary and theological **Reversal** of the Jonah narrative. Whereas Jonah fled *from* Joppa to avoid Gentiles, Peter purposefully goes forth *from* Joppa to embrace them."

        "With Peter, this makes a total of **seven** Jewish witnesses. In Scripture, the number seven consistently signifies divine completeness, perfection, and spiritual authority. The presence of seven witnesses ensured that the testimony about the Gentile conversion would be considered complete and unassailable under the Law ('on the evidence of two or three witnesses a matter shall be confirmed,' Deuteronomy 19:15)."

        "This occurred during a period of relative peace for the early church, allowing for the Gospel's expansion.",
        "**Purity Norms:** First-century rabbinic Judaism, through its Oral Law traditions, had constructed stringent social 'fences' around the Torah. Sharing a roof or a meal with a Gentile was strictly forbidden for an observant Jew, as it was believed to impart ritual defilement (Acts 10:28).",
        "Peter's action was a direct and shocking violation of these deeply entrenched cultural and religious norms; it was an act of radical faith over tradition.",
        "Peter's lodging was at the house of a tanner (Acts 9:43), a trade considered ritually 'unclean' due to its handling of dead animals. This context suggests Peter was already living on the margins of conventional purity laws, perhaps preparing his heart for this even greater leap of faith."

        "The detail that Simon the tanner's house was 'by the sea' (Acts 10:6) is geographically and culturally precise. Tanneries required large amounts of water and were kept on the outskirts of towns due to the powerful odor and ritual uncleanness associated with the trade."

        "The principle of corporate confirmation is established here. The presence of the six brothers from Joppa underscores the New Testament pattern of verifying and validating major new movements of the Holy Spirit through a plurality of witnesses (Acts 15:22; 2 Corinthians 13:1).",
        "This single act of showing hospitality to three Gentile strangers becomes the direct catalyst for the 'Gentile Pentecost' (Acts 10:44-47) and validates the universal scope of the Gospel: salvation is offered freely to 'everyone who believes,' Jew and Gentile alike (Romans 1:16, 10:12)."
