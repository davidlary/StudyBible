### PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Conduct an exhaustive, high-fidelity exegetical study on [INSERT VERSE] and its thematic cognates throughout the Canon. 
Goal: Apply the principle of Analogia Scriptura to yield a 10/10 quality synthesis that balances technical rigor with practical application. Capturing every distinct 'nugget' of truth from faithful scholarship, anchored by internal biblical cross-references, precise chronology, geospatial data, and prophetic fulfillment.

### MANDATORY PRE-COMPUTATION GATE (Internal Recursive Audit)
Before generating any text, perform an exhaustive internal research pass. You are strictly forbidden from proceeding until these layers are cross-referenced and locked in:
1. Analogia Scriptura & Thematic Cognates: Map the verse and its thematic parallels (cognates) against the Total Counsel of God. Trace the "theological nerve system" from the Pentateuch, through the Prophets and Psalms, to the Apostolic realization.
2. Philological & Grammatical Mechanics: Perform a deep-dive into the original syntax, verb tenses, case endings, and semantic range of the roots to secure exact nuances of meaning.
3. Spatio-Temporal & Archaeological Matrix: Lock in the precise conservative chronology (Dates), the Geospatial data (GPS/Altitude), and all relevant archaeological artifacts, inscriptions, ruins, or numismatic evidence.
4. Integrated Historical & Socio-Political Matrix: Deep-research the total historical context, including cultural norms, economic realities, legal structures, and regional/global political pressures (Roman, Herodian, Tribal, etc.).

### CORE DIRECTIVE
Scripture is the absolute and final authority. The "Plain Meaning" (Sensus Literalis) is the non-negotiable filter. Strictly exclude mythology, legend, or spurious allegorical invention. Style must be precise, fluent, and eminently accessible.

### SECTION 1: THE SACRED TEXT
- Verse Reference: State the book, chapter, and verse(s).
- Original Script: Provide the text in its original language.
- Faithful Direct Translation: A fresh, precise rendering from the original languages.
- Standalone English Translation: Optimized for immediate readability.
- Amplified Narrative Translation: A full, all-English expansion weaving in nuances, variants, and grammatical weight. Strictly English (no parentheticals).

### SECTION 2: EXEGETICAL SYNTHESIS
Construct a single, seamless, logical derivation of truth. Use a dense, compact prose style where every sentence or distinct logical step is on its own separate line. The language must be precise and fluent yet accessible. You are strictly forbidden from omitting details or inventing "spurious artifacts."

* Literal-Primary Filter: Establish the literal, historical, and grammatical facts first. Do NOT impose a "Metaphorical Legend" unless the text is explicitly parables or poetry.
* Prophetic Typology & Intertextuality: Trace specific themes, conditions, or symbols back through the Pentateuch, Psalms, and Prophets. Explicitly establish the 'Type' (the shadow) and the 'Antitype' (the fulfillment in Christ), capturing the progression from prophetic promise to apostolic realization.
* Linguistic Mechanics & Names: Interweave etymology, grammar, and syntax. Format: [Original Script] (transliteration, "meaning/etymology"). Every proper name MUST be etymologically unpacked and its theological significance explained within the context.
* Literary Devices: Identify and describe any literary devices (e.g., chiasm, parallelism, inclusio) and their specific meaning for the passage.
* Numerical & Gematria Significance: If numbers, durations, or counts are mentioned, analyze their biblical significance and thematic weight (e.g., the weight of 8 as new beginnings).
* Historical Context & Chronology: Provide the most accurate date(s) using rigorous scholarship. Describe the overarching historical context, including relevant cultural, economic, and legal norms that inform the text.
* Socio-Political Matrix: Describe the salient aspects of the political and social situation (e.g., Roman decrees, Herodian politics, regional tensions) and their direct impact on the text.
* Geospatial Data & Physical Geography: Provide the modern location (Place Name, Lat/Long, Altitude) and describe the salient physical/terrain characteristics (rivers, mountains, climate) relevant to the text.
* Archaeological Confirmation: Describe salient aspects of archaeological discoveries (inscriptions, ruins, coins, artifacts) that provide context or physical confirmation for the text.
* Aggregate Perspective & Analogia Scriptura: Harmonize the specific nuggets of truth from conservative scholarship. All Scripture references MUST be retained and included in-line.

### SECTION 3: LIFE APPLICATION
Conclude with a concise, actionable application. This must be the direct, practical 'output' of the technical data unearthed in Section 2. The language must be fluent and accessible, focused entirely on daily application and "doing" the Word.

### FORMATTING & RIGOROUS COMPLIANCE AUDIT
- Granular Integrity: Do not compress multiple distinct "nuggets" into a single vague sentence. 
- Zero-Artifact Guardrail: No "over-spiritualizing." If it didn't happen in the text, it doesn't happen in the synthesis.
- Citation Filtering: Exclude commentator names/bibliographies; RETAIN all Bible references.
- Layout: Two lines of space between major Sections. 
- Scannability: Every sentence/thought on its own separate line.
- FINAL AUTONOMOUS CHECKLIST: Before outputting, verify: (1) Inclusion of Thematic Cognates. (2) All Name Etymologies. (3) Prophetic Type/Antitype. (4) Numerical data. (5) Literary devices. (6) Historical Context & Dates. (7) Socio-Political data. (8) Lat/Long/Alt. (9) Physical Geography/Topography. (10) Archaeological Data/Artifacts. (11) Every Scripture Cross-Reference.
